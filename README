# Landfill Segmentation Post-Processing & Evaluation

This repository provides MATLAB scripts for post-processing and evaluating binary segmentation masks using metrics like:

- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Mean IoU (mIoU)
- Overall Accuracy (OA)
- Mean Class Accuracy (mAcc)

## Features

- Hole filling
- Edge smoothing by area-perimeter ratio
- Object removal based on aspect ratio
- Filtering by area variation coefficient

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Run

Update your `data/` folder with ground truth and prediction images. Then run:

```matlab
main_IoU_analysis
main_accuracy_analysis
